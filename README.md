# Python CliMenu
## Introduction
I created this class to generate & manipulate easily a menu in CLI.

Certainly that other projects or libraries offer this kind of solution.

I admit that I did not search too much on the net because in my opinion it was quite simple to create this kind of object.



I propose this base which can be adapted in other languages. I will make a PowerShell port.

You can use, modify, fork, ... This class as you like.

If you have any code improvement tips please let me know I do not have a lot of Python experience.

I am a bit of a dabbler in everything at one time I had a good experience in PHP, but I am a bit rusty since then :-D
## Requirement
import sys
## Compatibility
Python 3.6 or greater

Python 2.7 (I will check on a machien of my job, but I think it is good :-))

Coming soon
